# Guidelines for Contributors

Greetings, fellow human! We are glad that you appreciate the things that we, as humans, enjoy doing. This planet holds many wonders to be experienced, including:

* Snacks which are harmful to most non-humans, such as chocolate
* Less than a novel written about less-than-novel uses for containers
* Laundry machines which consistently consume one of the four socks that our human feet require

But you're probably here about the containers.

This project is an experiment, unleashed all at once onto an unsuspecting planet… with minimal concern for the consequences. Like all experiments, it is destined for obscurity and obsolescence. If you value this experiment, help keep it alive for awhile longer.

The human maintainer—yes, at the moment, only one—has many such experiments to conduct. The maintainer also hopes to discover the whereabouts of that missing sock. You can help the maintainer out by reducing the burden of maintainership as much as possible. Specifically, we request that your contributions have a high SIGNAL-TO-NOISE ratio.

## Contributions Sought

Contributions are encouraged which:

* Correct or report bugs that prevent this tutorial from working properly

* Update this tutorial for the latest Fedora, AlmaLinux, and/or podman releases

* Add to or expand on the existing tutorial [documentation](./README.md). This includes improving the readability, the accessibility, or the completeness of the existing text.

## Contributions Discouraged

This tutorial is intended to be simple and accessible. It is not a production-ready process, and the maintainer does not recommend using it as the basis of a Linux distro or as a deployment method. Contributions which significantly expand the scope or complexity of this tutorial are **discouraged** and are likely to be rejected. These include:

* Offering additional boot methods

* Supporting additional guest operating systems, like Debian

* Adding infrastructure or any ongoing maintenance burden, such as container registry builds

* Any concerns which are "[left as an exercise to the reader](./README.md#closing-remarks)"

If you've undertaken any of these tasks in your own project or repo, let us know and we'll gladly link to it.

## Next Steps

If you're not sure about your contribution, open a new issue and discuss it. If this tutorial has become obsolete or no longer reflects the state of the art, we will gladly hear alternatives.
